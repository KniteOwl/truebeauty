00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:45,023
(True Beauty)

2
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,508
Hello.

3
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:52,002
- Is this your second child? - Yes.

4
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:53,671
What a handsome young man!

5
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,971
It's actually a girl.

6
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,612
But Hee Kyung's so pretty.

7
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,881
Goodness, look how pretty she is.
She could enter a beauty pageant.

8
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:12,221
I knew since I was a kid
just by people's reactions...

9
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,121
that I'm ugly.

10
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:18,307
Grandpa!

11
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,532
Please take back that move.

12
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:22,362
- Just that last one. - Please?

13
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:25,731
No way, that's against the rules.

14
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,142
- Did you see that move? - No takebacks.

15
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,572
By the way, how is it that Ju Kyung...

16
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:33,172
only took after her mother's family?

17
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,841
If only she took after her dad too.

18
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,788
- She'll need plastic surgery. - Come on!

19
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:39,282
- Seriously? - Honey,

20
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:42,021
she must've been adopted or something.

21
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:44,392
- Grandpa! - You'll hurt her feelings.

22
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:49,821
All you need to do is get good grades,
got it?

23
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,407
Let the love as pure as gems...

24
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,547
bloom into the Flower of Hope.

25
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,571
Flowering Heart, Romantic Lips.

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,471
Makeup transformation!

27
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,187
Just like the cartoon character,

28
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,458
I once dreamed of magically...

29
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,928
transforming into a beautiful fairy.

30
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:18,068
Let the love as pure as gems...

31
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,652
bloom into the Flower of Hope.

32
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,762
Romantic Lips. Makeup transformation!

33
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,532
- What? - What is that?

34
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,538
- Who is she kidding? - What a joke.

35
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,232
She must think she's some fairy.

36
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,518
She's so full of herself.

37
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,022
She transformed into an ugly monster!

38
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,172
Die, you monster!

39
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,012
Guys!

40
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,557
But rather than a character
from a sweet cartoon...

41
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,488
("The Cursed Mask")

42
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,727
That's when I figured out...

43
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,951
I was more like a character
from a horror comic book...

44
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,251
born with a cursed face.

45
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:40,931
("The Cursed Mask")

46
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,551
Through the professor...

47
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,958
who only works his job
with no drive or energy,

48
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,928
the social injustice of
modern society is depicted.

49
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:00,621
If you take a look at
the following questions,

50
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,762
you'll find...

51
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,561
Boy, time sure did fly.

52
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,567
Don't forget your homework
that's due tomorrow.

53
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:07,831
Class is over.

54
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,301
- Sure. - Got it!

55
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:12,732
- Se Mi, here you go. - Yes.

56
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,042
Thanks.

57
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,317
Darn, my hair's all flat.

58
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,281
It serves you right for
resting your head on it.

59
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,612
- Fine, I'm sorry! - What is it?

60
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,922
Would you like to read this?

61
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,331
I'm not sure.

62
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,031
Would you like to listen to this?

63
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,672
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,212
Se Mi, can I try your lip tint?

65
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,787
Not even the best makeup will
make you as beautiful as her.

66
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,652
It's not for you to see,
so stop getting on my nerves.

67
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:02,482
Look at her.

68
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,722
What the... How pathetic.

69
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,422
Hey, Dumpling.

70
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,732
- Hey, Dumpling. - Hey, Dumpling.

71
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,602
Hey, Dumpling.

72
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,778
Did you call me?

73
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,931
No one else in this class goes by Dumpling.

74
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,042
Don't just stand there and be on your way.

75
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,248
Right now? Got it.

76
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,888
There goes the errand girl. Unbelievable.

77
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,758
Dumpling, the errand girl.

78
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,152
Tell me about it.

79
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,462
2 with meat and 1 with kimchi, right?

80
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,638
Get your fried chicken.

81
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,672
- I... - We'll take two dumplings.

82
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,272
I was here first.

83
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,818
Get lost.

84
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,112
- Enjoy, boys. - Thanks!

85
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,181
- 2 with meat - And 1 with kimchi, right?

86
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:02,582
Yes.

87
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,311
Thank you.

88
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:07,328
Hey, there.

(Cafeteria, Store)

90
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,462
Is Hyun Bin not here yet?

91
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,842
(Plain flour)

92
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:35,511
(Plain flour)

93
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,251
Hey, you.

94
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,482
Hyun Bin.

95
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:47,092
What? Is this Crash?

96
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,898
You know right away.

97
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,092
This is a classic.

98
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:56,032
Ju Kyung,
you and I have the same taste in music.

99
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:58,931
Just a second.

100
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:08,881
He's so attractive.

101
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:16,121
Now that's what I'm talking about.

102
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,797
Oh, yes.

103
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,121
My heart needs to stop pounding.

104
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:21,662
Calm down.

105
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,867
- Yes, that's it. - Calm down.

106
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:26,032
Oh, yes!

107
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:31,631
- 1, 2! - Calm down already!

108
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:34,371
Sorry. What did you just say?

109
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,641
No, it was nothing.

110
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,811
- Take it from me if you can. - Hey.

111
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,511
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

112
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:45,551
Is she steaming the dumplings herself?

113
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:48,722
- My gosh, look at her. - What is it?

114
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,551
- What is it? - What?

115
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:51,821
Who is he?

116
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:56,121
Isn't he the cafeteria guy
who always hits on you?

117
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,938
I guess they have good
chemistry or something.

118
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,832
Nice! Yes, that's it!

119
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,441
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

120
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,511
Isn't Hyun Bin so attractive?

121
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,388
I'm not sure.

122
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,558
He told me he and I have
the same taste in music,

123
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,212
and he just smiled at me too.

124
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:22,852
Don't you think he's also interested in me?

125
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,451
I'm not sure.

126
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,551
I'm thinking of asking him out tomorrow.

127
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:29,691
Isn't that a great idea?

128
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:32,638
I'm... I'm not sure.

129
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,832
Hey, look at Ju Kyung.

130
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,138
She's wearing white
socks over black tights.

131
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,501
If I give you 10,000 dollars,
would you go out with her?

132
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,302
I won't go out with her even if
you give me 100,000 dollars.

133
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,941
I'm going to eat a little later.

134
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,571
What?

135
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,412
Keep moving.

136
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:54,582
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

137
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,652
Here you go.

138
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:58,191
There.

139
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,751
Enjoy.

140
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,891
Hyun Bin.

141
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,732
Can we meet tomorrow...

142
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,832
during lunchtime?

143
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,602
Tomorrow? Sure.

144
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:15,541
Look at Ju Kyung.

145
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,241
I can't believe she's hitting on him.

146
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,497
Can you put some strength into it?

147
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,328
Son, what are you doing outside?

148
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:06,627
Are you hungry? Do you want some fruit?

149
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,722
No.

150
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,538
Ju Kyung, why aren't you studying?

151
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,507
What did you do in the kitchen all weekend?

152
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,977
I just made something.

153
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,178
Do something about your grades, will you?

154
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,178
- Your grades got worse last time...
- Okay, I'll deal with it on my own.

155
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,278
Ju Kyung! I'm not done talking!

156
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:26,011
Just let her deal with it.

157
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,812
- Let's watch the show.
- Whom does she take after?

158
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,112
What?

159
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,781
- Massage my left shoulder too.
- Okay, you got it.

161
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,791

back the money I invested?)

162
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,131
Concentrate.

163
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:49,602
Okay. Just a second.

164
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,432
The door is open.

165
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,832
- My daughter, you're home. - Yes.

166
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:56,602
It's urgent. I need to go.

167
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,281
- The door is locked.
- Is it number 1 or number 2?

168
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,541
Number two.

169

170
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,612
Do you want me to feed you my poop?

171
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:09,682
Go to the bathroom in the master bedroom.

172
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,227
- The master bedroom.
- You might poop your pants.

173
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,428
- Hold your bottom. - Okay.

174
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,227
- You'll poop your pants.
- Keep it clenched.

175
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,521
- My gosh. - Breathe.

176
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,391

00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,631
Oh, my goodness!

185
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,901
Will you go out with me?

186
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:04,602
Will you please turn down the music?

187
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,712
I'd rather go blind.

188
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,381
What's with her?

189
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,397
(Se Yeon, you will always be in my heart.)

190
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,781
(Happy birthday,
Se Yeon. I hope you're happy in paradise.)

191
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,291
Se Yeon's fans are so weird.

192
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,062
Didn't they badmouth him before he died?

193
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,942
Why are they suddenly acting
like they're sad about his death?

194
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,472
What a bunch of hypocrites.

195
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,918
I'm going to confess my
love to the guy I like today.

196
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:38,411

You have no idea how
shocked I was when I heard that.

Compared to a good-looking guy like you,

243

244
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:10,192

You're too nice to her
because you're so kind.

I bet that's why she
thinks she deserves you.

249
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:23,448
Well, yes. I tend to be pretty kind.

250
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:27,141
To be honest,
when I heard about you and Ju Kyung,

251

I got really upset.

252
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:35,011

making you feel that way.

I don't want to die.

364
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:31,834
Gosh, it's cold.

365
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:20,854
What a relief.

366
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,683
What on earth was that?

367
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:55,784
My glasses...

368
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:57,554
Where are they?

369
00:26:58,794 --> 00:26:59,894
My glasses...

370
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,594
Where are my glasses?

371
00:27:04,693 --> 00:27:06,763
I can't see anything without them.

372
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,503
Where are my glasses?

373
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:10,903
What were you up to just now?

374
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,243
Were you going to jump?

375
00:27:16,374 --> 00:27:17,443
Are you insane?

376
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,483
Have you lost your mind?

377
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:23,054
What could be hard enough
to make you want to die?

378
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:26,483
How could you give
up on your life like this?

379
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:28,560
I wasn't going to jump...

380
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,664
You should try to overcome
the difficulties instead.

381
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:34,463
Have you even considered how devastated...

382
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:37,663
your loved ones would be?

383
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,463
- I... - Someone...

384
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,604
might forever live in guilt...

385
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,304
for not being able to save you.

386
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:51,743
Understand?

387
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,054
There's nothing you can do...

388
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:03,723
for a dead person.

389
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:07,423
So don't die.

390
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,854
Why aren't you coming?
Is it to jump once I leave?

391
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,953
No, that's not it.

392
00:28:38,854 --> 00:28:39,993
It's just...

393
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,223
Excuse me...

394
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,634
My glasses...

395
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:50,780
Wait a second!

396
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:53,044
(Elevator Maintenance)

397
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,644
What is it?

398
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,314
Is it out of order?

399
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:06,024
Wait for me, sir!

400
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:10,854
Please wait for me.

401
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:14,423
Wait for me.

402
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:19,564
You knocked my glasses off
me and now I can't see a thing.

403
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:23,473
I'm blind without them.

404
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:27,173
Without them,

405
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:30,144
I can't even tell poop and doenjang apart.

406
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,223
Darn it.

407
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:52,733
Excuse me. Are you still there?

408
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,473
He must really be gone.

409
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:04,274
Darn, my life!

410
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,953
What?

411
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:20,723
I see you haven't left.

412
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:22,493
Take my hand and stand.

413
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:24,534
Sure.

414
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,644
- Watch your hands! - I...

415
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:41,213
It was never my intention to grope you.

416
00:30:45,114 --> 00:30:46,253
Get on my back instead.

417
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:54,594
Thank you.

418
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,403
I know I'm heavier than I seem, mister.

419
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,743
You look heavy too.

420
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:12,563
And who are you calling "mister"?

421
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:27,294
Excuse me.

422
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,594
I have something to ask.

423
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:32,840
Mister, why were you at the rooftop...

424
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,703
Lady, stop whispering, will you?

425
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:40,274
My voice echoing is scary, that's why.

426
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:41,550
Also, I'm not some old lady.

427
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:43,114
Can't you see I'm in a school uniform?

428
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:50,653
Did you perhaps...

429
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:53,923
know someone who was
at the rooftop like I was?

430
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:58,953
It just makes sense.

431
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:02,394
You pulled me back to
safety but then got all angry.

432
00:32:02,794 --> 00:32:05,394
I was wondering if
anyone around you died...

433
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:07,804
Say another word...

434
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:09,874
and I'll leave you behind.

435
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,673
Darn, she's heavy.

436
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:22,989
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

437
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,860
- Lady! - Okay, I won't say a word.

438
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:27,784
My lips are sealed.

439
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:45,149
(Elevator Maintenance)

440
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:48,374
Sir, wasn't the elevator out of order?

441
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:51,544
It was just getting a maintenance check.

442
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:53,183
Didn't you hear the announcement?

443
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:54,943
All right.

444
00:32:57,653 --> 00:33:00,054
Maybe we should've waited.

445
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:16,774
Hey, mister!

446
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,173
Again with the "mister"?

447
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:25,314
What?

448
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:28,683
Well,

449
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:32,584
I know I'm not in a position to say this,

450
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:37,794
but cheer up.

451
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:42,863
The one who died...

452
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:48,334
won't want those left
behind to suffer for too long.

453
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:53,473
It's why you should be happy.

454
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,573
You must, okay?

455
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:02,183
Please take me to Bucheon, please.

456
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,040
Why go up there anyway...

457
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:20,203
when you're not even brave enough to jump?

458
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,909
I just got those glasses.

459
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,504
Gosh, Mom will be mad.

460
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:31,020
You'll be transferred to
voicemail after the beep...

461
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,644
and will be charged.

462
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:36,584
Mom, I was hoping to hear your voice.

463
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,124
Actually, no.

464
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:43,453
It's better this way.

465
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:48,924
I won't be able to die
if I hear your voice.

466
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,163
Thank you...

467
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:55,904
for bringing me to this world
and raising me for 18 years.

468
00:34:56,404 --> 00:35:00,144
I promise to be born as
your daughter in my next life.

469
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,573
That's when we'll meet again.

470
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:05,073
When we do,

471
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:08,584
I hope I get to have a
face everyone calls pretty.

472
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:17,493
Oh, no.

473
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,223
What if Mom checked the voicemail?

474
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:23,444
I hope she hasn't listened to it yet.

475
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,263
Why isn't she picking up?

476
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,404
- Sir, can you drive faster? - Sure.

477
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,544
Please pick up. Please.

478
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:39,473
(My daughter, Ju Kyung)

479
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:49,799
Mom, please. Take her to her room.

480
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:51,654
Let me go. You darn punk.

481
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:54,593
They found a ship loaded with
treasures near Ulleung Island?

482
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,299
- You actually believed that?
- If you think about it,

483
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,239
it's not entirely impossible.

484
00:35:58,263 --> 00:36:01,839
Back in 1905,
during the Russo-Japanese War...

485
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:03,834
I don't care about the Russo-Japanese War.

486
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,904
I'll show you what a war is,
you son of a gun!

487
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:10,319
No, wait! Mom, please!

488
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:12,089
- Grab her! - Let me go.

489
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:14,460
- No, don't.
- A famous ship sunk during the war.

490
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:15,489
It's a historical fact.

491
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:17,989
My life is about to sink
underwater because of you.

492
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:21,883
Do you think 500,000 dollars is easy money?

493
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:23,953
How could you invest that much money?

494
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:27,493
You're 50 years old,
and we're still paying rent!

495
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:30,609
Dad, hurry up and apologize! Come on!

496
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,133
- My gosh. - Hurry!

497
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:33,909
Honey, I'm sorry.

498
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,104
Hyun Sook, I'm truly sorry.

499
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:39,154
- Forgive me just this once.
- Don't expect me to forgive you.

500
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:42,580
I'll kill you today and get
myself locked up in jail.

501
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:45,214
- No, please! - Mom. Mom.

502
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,389
- My gosh. I'm sorry. - Dad, this way.

503
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,814
- I'm sorry. - Mom.

504
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,029
- Wait. Mom. - Stop right there.

505
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:52,584
- Here. - My gosh.

506
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,254
Get over here. Now.

507
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,254
- Stop it. - You little...

508
00:36:58,823 --> 00:37:01,064
- My gosh. - There!

509
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:02,663
Seriously?

510
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:36,460
The one who died won't
want those left behind...

511
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,294
to suffer for too long.

512
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:42,493
It's why you should be happy.

513
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:11,953
Mom. Mom.

514
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:14,763
I'd rather just die instead.

515
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:22,964
Mom! Mom, don't die!

516
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,274
Hey, you're here.

517
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:30,573
I can't possibly leave you guys behind.

518
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:37,984
Let's all die together. Let's do that.

519
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:41,359
I won't ever say that again,
so please don't cry.

520
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:43,794
How can I not cry?

521
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:47,794
My darn life.

522
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:52,033
It's all because I was born ugly.

523
00:39:52,464 --> 00:39:55,179
Hee Kyung and Ju Young
were born with Dad's looks.

524
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:56,834
But I wasn't. That's why.

525
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:00,703
- What? - It's true.

526
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:04,944
I'm ugly because I take after you.

527
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:06,720
What did you say?

528
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:09,219
Will you please get a
grasp of what's going on?

529
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,759
Ju Kyung, shut it.

530
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,529
I won't die, so let me get plastic surgery.

531
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:14,799
That will solve everything.

532
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:17,529
Have you lost your mind? Why
do you want plastic surgery?

533
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:18,670
Do you want to get kicked out?

534
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:21,723
You're better off with a pretty
daughter than an ugly one.

535
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:25,093
Don't make things worse.
Just go. Get out of my sight!

536
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,409
- Come on. - Let me get plastic surgery.

537
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,440
- Get over here.
- Let me get plastic surgery.

538
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:30,973
I'm the only one who
takes after your looks.

539
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:33,944
- Let me get plastic surgery.
- Will you please be quiet?

540
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:46,359
(Friends)

541
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:47,683
(Hye Min)

I guess I was the only one
who thought we were friends.

546
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,883
Starting from tomorrow,
I'll really be all alone.

547
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,413

549
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:25,993
Ju Kyung, are you sleeping?

550
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:27,493
I was just about to sleep.

551
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,863
Mom and I are off to have
soju. Get some sleep, okay?

552
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:41,679
I shouldn't have left that voice message.

553
00:41:41,703 --> 00:41:43,444
It only ended up breaking Mom's heart.

554
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,013
Back when...

555
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:55,624
I bought our apartment,

556

couldn't sleep for days.

- Are you going to sell our house?
- What else can I do?

558
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,339
We can't even find a
tenant for our old house,

559
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,243
so we won't be able
to sell it at a good price.

560
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:08,504
I'll sell this house, pay off his debt,

561
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:10,279
and move into the old house.

562
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,980
Don't do that. I'll get my
severance pay in advance...

563
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:16,343
- and look into getting a loan...
- Forget it.

564
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:18,664

579

00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:48,283
What do you mean? Anyway,
I'm off to school!

720
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,770
Gosh, who on earth is she?

721
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:56,294
- She's stunning! - Who?

722
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:58,443
- I haven't seen her before. - Me neither.

723
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,449
Can you believe it?

724
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:06,803
- She's beautiful? - No way!

725
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,843
This can't be real.

726
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:15,544
(Saebom High School, Lim Ju Kyung)

727
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:18,993
She's absolutely beautiful.

728
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:21,154
Aphrodite is reborn.

729
00:55:29,263 --> 00:55:30,464
I'm...

730
00:55:32,234 --> 00:55:33,533
beautiful?

731
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,743
- My gosh. - I can't believe it.

732
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,743
Can this be true?

733
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,913
My gosh, she's stunning.

734
00:55:51,513 --> 00:55:53,113
Where's the teachers' office?

735
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:00,964
What on earth?

736
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,104
She's beautiful.

737
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:15,104
(Stop pretending to be ladylike.)

738
00:56:15,374 --> 00:56:17,080
(Says the one pretending
to be a model student.)

739
00:56:17,104 --> 00:56:18,420
(- What? - Why you...)

740
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:20,650
Although you didn't live so far away,

741
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:22,343
I bet you haven't fully adjusted yet.

742
00:56:22,383 --> 00:56:24,929
I lived here until I was 10, so I'm good.

743
00:56:24,953 --> 00:56:26,053
I'm glad to hear that.

744
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,424
Here. Starting today,
you go to Saebom High School.

745
00:56:31,323 --> 00:56:32,394
Right.

746
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:37,524
(Lim Ju Kyung, Saebom High School)

747
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,894
I hear that the new student
used to be at the top of her class.

748
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:44,104
It must be her.

749
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,674
Let me see her grades.

750
00:56:47,803 --> 00:56:50,750
Doesn't she already seem
like one to have great grades?

751
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,013
(Grades)

752
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:54,984
Forget it.

753
00:56:56,383 --> 00:56:58,830
This must be the student
who was at the top of his class.

754
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:01,259
See? Doesn't he look like one...

755
00:57:01,283 --> 00:57:02,553
to have great grades?

756
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,024
We'll get going then.

757
00:57:05,194 --> 00:57:07,670
Of course. Introduce
yourself to your classmates.

758
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,564
He's the vice-principal,
but don't be bothered by his words.

759
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,163
Grades don't always mean the world.

760
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:14,734
Sure.

761
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,750
If it isn't the top of our junior class!

762
00:57:17,774 --> 00:57:19,810
No wonder it suddenly got brighter in here.

763
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:21,544
Gosh, he's handsome.

764
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:26,814
See? Can one be more charming when bowing?

765
00:57:27,883 --> 00:57:29,783
- Here you go. - Thanks.

766
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:32,183
Why does that voice sound familiar?

767
00:57:32,354 --> 00:57:34,154
But please ask the
class president next time.

768
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:36,529
- Sure. - Never have I come across...

769
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,500
such a handsome being before.

770
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:39,694
Soo Ho.

771
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:43,093
This is a transfer
student joining our class.

772
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:44,863
Could you escort her?

773
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:46,894
Must I? Really?

774
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:51,473
Yes, you must.

775
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,203
- Follow him out. - Sure.

776
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,513
Wait for me.

777
00:58:01,383 --> 00:58:03,913
Handsome and top of the class?

778
00:58:04,084 --> 00:58:05,589
I guess life really is unfair.

779
00:58:05,613 --> 00:58:07,354
Wait... Soo Ho!

780
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:15,069
I thought this foundation didn't rub off!

781
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:18,540
Are we close? Why are
you acting like we are?

782
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,839
Soo Ho, I mean... Are you free?

783
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:23,310
- No, I'm busy. - It won't take long.

784
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,604
I have something to say to you.

785
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:27,750
- You have three seconds. - What?

786
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:29,350
- One... - Soo Ho, I mean...

787
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:31,113
- 2, 3, time's up. - I've always liked you.

788
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,814
- No. - Then please accept this.

789
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,814
(Lee Soo Ho)

790
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,964
Wait a second. My gosh.

791
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:54,033
My face! What if my makeup's gone?

792
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:57,703
1, 2...

793
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:03,274
- Hey, Soo Ho. - Hey, friend.

794
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,413
Just a second.

795
00:59:07,374 --> 00:59:09,984
What's that on your
back? Is it a new trend?

796
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,714
How sophisticated.

797
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:14,484
What is that on his back? Makeup?

798
00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:24,093
I'm glad my eye makeup is still there.

799
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,374
Hey!

800
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,703
What's his problem?

801
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,084
But I only bought this recently.

802
00:59:46,513 --> 00:59:49,424
Joining our class as of
today is Lim Ju Kyung.

803
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:50,723
Would you like to say hello?

804
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,699
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

805
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,263
You're beautiful!

806
00:59:57,624 --> 00:59:58,839
Is this for real?

807
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:00,834
Being pretty made a difference...

808
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:03,504
regarding how the kids look at me.

809
01:00:03,663 --> 01:00:05,473
Welcome!

810
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,279
All except one person.

811
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:10,473
We're now a better-looking class.

812
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:14,944
Ahn Hyun Kyu, don't you say that...

813
01:00:15,214 --> 01:00:17,714
because you're all beautiful in my eyes.

814
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:21,560
You look beautiful from a distance
and even more stunning up close.

815
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,330
Must you be so cheesy?

816
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:25,593
I know you're not aware
of how beautiful you are,

817
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:30,163
but being 18 makes you the
most stunning people ever,

818
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:33,440
so don't try so hard to look
better. Especially you, Soo Ah.

819
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,564
Got it.

820
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:37,564
Must you be so serious all the time?

821
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:43,743
Ju Kyung, let's see. The
seat next to Soo Ho's is vacant.

822
01:00:46,314 --> 01:00:47,984
I have bad eyesight, you see.

823
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:52,084
Is that so? The seat belongs
to another student on a break,

824
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,654
but sit behind Soo Ah.

825
01:00:54,453 --> 01:00:55,553
Sure.

826
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:01,663
What's today's first class? Mine, right?

827
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:03,794
- Open your books then. - Got it.

828
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,080
Do you all remember the poets...

829
01:01:08,104 --> 01:01:10,163
who were members of Cheongnokpa?

830
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:11,549
- No! - No!

831
01:01:11,573 --> 01:01:14,374
Of course,
you don't remember. So Cheongnokpa...

832
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:18,144
consisted of poets who wrote
about nature that embodied...

833
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:20,049
- Here. - eternity and humanity.

834
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:22,560
- Thanks. - Pak Tu Jin, Park Mok Wol,

835
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:26,113
and Cho Chi Hun got together
and published their first book...

836
01:01:26,254 --> 01:01:27,413
titled "Cheonglokjib".

837
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:33,330
Good job, everyone. Don't
forget to do your assignments.

838
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:34,694
- Bye! - Good day.

839
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:36,723
Gosh, this is awkward.

840
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,194
I saw you at the front gate today.

841
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:41,433
Really?

842
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:42,863
Hi, new girl.

843
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:45,033
Hi.

844
01:01:45,104 --> 01:01:46,473
Can I get your number?

845
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,473
Right.

846
01:01:49,274 --> 01:01:50,954
Are you on Stargram? What's your username?

847
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:52,913
I don't have a Stargram account.

848
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:55,314
Why not? Are you trying to be mysterious?

849
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:58,183
Followers will pile up the
second you create one.

850
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:02,154
I love the colour of your
lips. Which lip tint do you use?

851
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:06,093
Oh, really? My lip tint...

852
01:02:15,703 --> 01:02:16,904
She's gorgeous...

853
01:02:17,303 --> 01:02:19,504
and apparently with no makeup on.

854
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,203
Here you go.

855
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:23,803
Thanks.

856
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:26,274
Hey, Soo Jin.

857
01:02:26,513 --> 01:02:27,790
She's my best friend, Kang Soo Jin.

858
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:29,359
I've been calling her
the queen of our school,

859
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:31,103
but that might change now that you're here.

860
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:32,730
I guess you have competition now.

861
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:35,053
Don't pat my behind like that.

862
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:37,754
Ju Kyung, right? It's good to meet you.

863
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:39,069
Same here.

864
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:42,524
You're gorgeous though.
Are you a K-pop idol trainee?

865
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:46,093
She talks a lot, doesn't she? I
hope you don't find it annoying.

866
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,133
It's fine.

867
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:51,810
I get that it was my fault,

868
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,904
but how can he throw this at my face?

869
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,573
I'll wash it off for you, darn it.

870
01:03:00,013 --> 01:03:02,814
Why won't this come off?

871
01:03:07,453 --> 01:03:09,723
It's waterproof. Oh, no.

872
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:12,854
Gosh, I can't believe it.

873
01:03:17,863 --> 01:03:19,093
Sorry.

874
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:24,850
You know, I can have this dry cleaned...

875
01:03:24,874 --> 01:03:26,274
Toss it in the trash.

876
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,644
How can I throw this away?

877
01:03:28,774 --> 01:03:30,843
I'll return it to you spotless!

878
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:34,314
Ju Kyung, what's with Soo Ho?

879
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,683
I got something on his jacket,
and he told me to throw it away.

880
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:41,683
The jerk's at it again.

881
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:45,529
That's how he normally is.
The handsome psychopath.

882
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:46,953
- Really? - Yes.

883
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:48,964
So he's a cocky jerk.

884
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:51,710
- Ju Kyung, dumplings...
- Sure, I'll get them for you.

885
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:53,294
That's not it.

886
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:56,004
I was asking you to join us.

887
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:58,933
- Together? - Yes.

888
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:04,920
I can't believe you snagged her
before she could make friends.

889
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:07,613
What's wrong with that? She's mine, anyway.

890
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:10,743
You sure are quick when
it comes to making friends.

891
01:04:11,453 --> 01:04:13,754
So Ju Kyung, what do you enjoy?

892
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,654
I like heavy metal and
horror comic books but...

893
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:20,199
I like reading books
and listening to music.

894
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,770
What kind of music? I'm
a huge fan of Eighteen.

895
01:04:22,794 --> 01:04:24,834
And I love spicy food.

896
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:26,710
I really like spicy food as well.

897
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:28,679
Really? That's great!

898
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:31,473
Then why don't we eat
tteokbokki after school today...

899
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,453
to congratulate our
first day of being friends?

900
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:35,944
Sure. That sounds nice.

901
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:37,774
We're friends.

902
01:04:38,444 --> 01:04:40,449
- Doo Jin, will you join us? - Sure.

903
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:43,783
But it's Soo Jin,
not Doo Jin. Say my name properly.

904
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:47,383
Okay, Soo Jin, you smarty-pants
with the second-highest grades.

905
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,429
Soo Ho and Soo Jin always compete
to get the best grades in our year.

906
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,199
She's not only pretty,
but she's also smart.

907
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,093
Don't tell me you're smart too.

908
01:04:55,663 --> 01:04:56,894
I have bad grades.

909
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,469
That's perfect.

910
01:04:58,493 --> 01:05:01,064
Ju Kyung, just be a pretty girl like me.

911
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:04,303
But I'm not pretty.

912
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:06,533
Soo Ah, you really need to study.

913
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:08,374
- Why? - Let me help you study.

914
01:05:08,473 --> 01:05:10,803
- No, I'm not interested.
- You need to get better grades.

915
01:05:11,144 --> 01:05:12,944
Ju Kyung, let's study together.

916
01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:18,060
There we go. You can eat it now.

917
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:19,183
Okay.

918
01:05:19,254 --> 01:05:20,354
Let's enjoy.

919
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:24,560
- What do you think? - It's really good.

920
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:25,794
- It's good, right? - Yes.

921
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:31,593
But it's a bit spicy.

922
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:36,109
Doo Jin, please. Just this once.

923
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,104
- No, let's go next time. - Come on.

924
01:05:38,633 --> 01:05:41,880
- Just 10 minutes.
- My mom will get angry at me.

925
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,279
Then five minutes. It won't take long.

926
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:44,874
I don't have five minutes.

927
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,944
Ju Kyung, let's try everything that's here.

928
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,254
You too, Soo Jin.

929
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,553
(A beginner in life,
A pro at playing games)

930
01:05:57,953 --> 01:05:59,529
Did you see that? I have the highest score.

931
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:00,699
Didn't I get any?

932
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:01,964
That's the boss.

933
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:04,964
Come on.

934
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:07,334
Keep going.

935
01:06:09,104 --> 01:06:12,433
Keep going! Nice! Look at that!

936
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:19,243
This is so fun.

937
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:22,613
Ju Kyung, you should try it too.

938
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,413
Is this how you do it?

939
01:06:25,913 --> 01:06:27,013
Yes, good.

940
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:29,854
You're pretty good.

941
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:38,069
You look really cute.

942
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:39,194
Let's begin.

943
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,064
Look over here.

944
01:06:43,964 --> 01:06:45,210
Ju Kyung,
is it your first time taking photos?

945
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,234
- You need to look here. - Oh, there?

946
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,404
Pose.

947
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:06,099
In the past, no matter how hard I tried,

948
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:07,723
I could never have what I truly wanted.

949
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:10,923
Friends.

950
01:07:13,564 --> 01:07:16,133
But I have friends now.

951
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,744
Gosh.

952
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:35,654
Get up.

953
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,943
Why are you overdoing it?
You haven't been here in a while.

954
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:08,284
So I can get some good sleep.

955
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:10,103
You're having trouble sleeping again?

956
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:13,194
It looks like you've gotten worse.

957
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:20,093
Then I'll help you knock out tonight.

958
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:27,473
This won't knock me out.

959
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,173
Hey, stop. That's enough.

960
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:50,040
(Soo Ah has invited Soo
Jin and Ju Kyung to the chat.)

961
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:52,293
(Soo Ah: Did you guys go home safely?)

962
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:54,734
Is this the group chat
that everyone always...

963
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:57,963
talks about?

964
01:09:01,034 --> 01:09:03,003
I got invited to a group chat.

965
01:09:03,274 --> 01:09:04,574
Did you guys go home safely?

966
01:09:05,543 --> 01:09:07,414
Yes, what about you, Soo Jin?

967
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:10,620
- Soo Jin rarely checks her phone.
- Oh, I see.

968
01:09:10,644 --> 01:09:12,859
By the way, I have a Stargram account now.

969
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,390
My ID is imzoo...

970
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:16,130
Nice. I'll follow you right now.

971
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:17,234
I'm studying with my tutor.

972
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:20,123
Here are the photos we took
today. Just download what you want.

973
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:39,220
Ju Young, what are you doing?

974
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:41,473
I know you're my sister,

975
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,244
but you're seriously so ugly.

976
01:09:43,784 --> 01:09:44,890
- What? - Come on.

977
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,013
People at school think you're pretty.

978
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,024
Should I show them this photo?

979
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,654
Ju Young, delete it right now.

980
01:09:52,723 --> 01:09:54,769
Get over here. Are you serious right now?

981
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:56,093
- Come here. - You want this?

982
01:09:56,223 --> 01:09:59,793
Delete it. Delete it
right now. I'm serious.

983
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:02,239
- You punk. - "You punk."

984
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:03,939
- Do you have a death wish?
- "Do you have a death wish?"

985
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,923
What's the matter? This
is how you normally look.

986
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:10,343
Is this what you're looking
for? You're too slow.

987
01:10:10,644 --> 01:10:11,704
Watch your left.

988
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:14,843
- Get off me. - You're dead.

989
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,784
Listen, young lady.

990
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,713
Let's keep our manners.

991
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,283
I feel a chill behind my back.

992
01:10:51,444 --> 01:10:53,883
It's as if a dagger just
pierced through my chest.

993
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:56,923
But don't worry.

994
01:10:57,284 --> 01:10:59,494
My hands move faster than
what the human eye can see.

995
01:11:01,454 --> 01:11:02,569
Get over here!

996
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:03,923
My neck hurts! Get off me!

997
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:07,164
(Insert passcode)

998
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:09,463
Do you think I'm dumb?

999
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:18,274
What do you want?

1000
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:20,393
The newly released volume
of "You're the Demon".

1001
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,183
Then will you delete it?

1002
01:11:22,914 --> 01:11:24,183
That depends on how you behave.

1003
01:11:24,683 --> 01:11:26,290
Do you have a death wish?

1004
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:28,354
Which photo should I upload?

1005
01:11:29,423 --> 01:11:30,484
Stop.

1006
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:41,741
I'll add something on top of that.

1007
01:11:45,381 --> 01:11:48,451
You can have the new volume
and a pack of instant cup noodles.

1008
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:51,621
Deal.

1009
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:15,852
What a relief.

1010
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:31,977
I'm following you now. I
see you uploaded a photo.

1011
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,578
My gosh, you already got tons of likes.

1012
01:12:34,602 --> 01:12:35,732
Oh, really?

1013
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:38,477
- Can we be Stargram friends?
- You're so beautiful.

1014
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:39,778
Can you follow me too?

1015
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:41,778
- You're really pretty.
- I got over 100 likes.

1016
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:43,442
- You're gorgeous. - She's a real beauty.

1017
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:46,351
I can't believe they think I'm beautiful.

1018
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:48,812
This is absurd.

1019
01:12:53,682 --> 01:12:55,602
What if people from our
school see me like this?

1020
01:13:01,192 --> 01:13:04,607
(Prince Comics)

1021
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:07,631
My goodness,
this place hasn't changed at all.

1022
01:13:08,932 --> 01:13:10,607
I wonder if the owner is still the same.

1023
01:13:10,631 --> 01:13:15,102
(Prince Comics)

1024
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:20,911
Gosh, it's exactly the same.

1025
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:23,581
Welcome.

1026
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,621
Mister, you're still here.

1027
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:30,522
- Who... - Don't you remember me?

1028
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,262
Ju Kyung?

1029
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:33,661
Yes.

1030
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:35,661
You're finally back.

1031
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,161
Your mom told me you guys moved back here.

1032
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,961
Gosh, how long has it been?

1033
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:41,802
I think it's been about eight years.

1034
01:13:41,972 --> 01:13:43,307
Has it been that long already?

1035
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:46,847
My gosh, you've grown so
big. You haven't changed at all.

1036
01:13:46,871 --> 01:13:48,302
Yes, I'm still ugly.

1037
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:50,311
I was going to say you're still so cute.

1038
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,052
This one's fun.

1039
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:05,762
The smell of comic books.

1040
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,711
The stuff I scribbled
on the wall is still here.

1041
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:16,531
(Lim Ju Kyung's spot. Sit without
permission, and get a hairy butt!)

1042
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:22,712
This is what I'm talking about.

1043
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:25,711
No one has a horror
collection quite as big as theirs.

1044
01:14:29,751 --> 01:14:31,881
Where is it?

1045
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:36,491
Found it.

1046
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:52,948
I was here first.

1047
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:54,541
I grabbed it first.

1048
01:15:24,772 --> 01:15:25,871
Lee Soo Ho?

1049
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:29,442
You.

1050
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:31,772
I'm done for.

1051
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:14,222
(True Beauty)

1052
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:17,321
I'll make sure he doesn't
think I'm Lim Ju Kyung.

1053
01:16:20,362 --> 01:16:21,661
What if he knows?

1054
01:16:22,022 --> 01:16:23,267
Did you do something wrong?

1055
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:25,732
He'll feel too sorry for
me to spread rumours.

1056
01:16:26,902 --> 01:16:28,701
Hey. We've met, haven't we?

1057
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:30,977
What an outrageous coincidence.

1058
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:32,241
Are you and Soo Ho going out?

1059
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:35,302
- Now? - You have something for me.

1060
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:37,588
- Bring it. - The no-makeup Ju Kyung?

1061
01:16:37,612 --> 01:16:38,589
The full-makeup Ju Kyung?

1062
01:16:38,613 --> 01:16:41,482
What am I supposed to bring him?

1063
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:43,506
